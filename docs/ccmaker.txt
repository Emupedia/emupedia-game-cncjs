        How to Create Your Own Command & Conquer Mission  v1.6

   Note: Before I get sued, a LOT of the information within this manual
and the basic format of this manual has been taken from an original manual
written by Han Brunger (j.brunger@a1.nl) who deserves a lot of credit for
making the original. This manual should be all you need short of some
experience to make some good C&C missions. What separates this from Han
Brunger's original is that this document contains an enormous amount of more
information (50k) that has been discovered since his original writing (20k).
   You may freely, and I encourage, you to distribute this document as you
please, so long as credit is given to me.

******************
1. Getting Started
******************

   Before anything else, I will assume that you have MIXMAN and CCMAP which
you will need. Once you have these programs, read the MIXMAN documentation
to learn how to extract an INI file and a MAP file from a GENERAL.MIX file
from either Command & Conquer CD. The next step is to edit the INI file
with any standard ASCII text editor such as DOS EDIT or WINDOWS NOTEPAD
to decide how large and what type of map you will use (refer to section
2.2 MAP for more information). Once you have done this, you may use CCMAP
to create your map anyway you like.
   Finally comes the real hard part, the ever daunting task of editing the
INI file which you will need this manual for desperately.

****************************
2. Text Editing the INI File
****************************

   The INI file is a standard ASCII text file which contains several sections
headers within [ and ]. All of these sections describe what can be found on
the map, and what will occur during the mission when it is played. Within
the INI file, you may also note that you may include comments by preceding
them with a semi-colon, ";".
   I will now go through the several sections and attempt to explain them
fully for you to understand.

***********
2.1 [Basic]
***********

   As you might guess, this describes the basics of the mission. Usually
you won't have to change much here. This is what it'll probably look like.
Note: Numbers in brackets, { }, are not a part of the section.

[Basic]
CarryOverMoney=10     {1}
CarryOverCap=-1       {2}
Percent=100           {3}
Intro=X               {4}
Brief=X               {5}
Action=X              {6}
Lose=X                {7}
Win=X                 {8}
BuildLevel=13         {9}
Theme=No theme       {10}
Player=GoodGuy       {11}
Name=Beta Mission    {12}

1: Amount of credits that the player will carry over from the previous
   mission divided by 100. For example, 10 means 1000 credits.
2: Most likely is a cap over how much money you can carry over. That is,
   a limit as to how much money you get from your last mission to prevent
   you from starting with too much money.
3: Wish I knew. Possibly also related to CarryOverMoney, by specifying what
   percentage of the money you get?

(If you make a mission that isn't part of a continuing campaign, then the
 above three values will have no effect and you probably should delete them.)

4: Introduction video played first.
5: Briefing Video, played after Introduction Video.
6: Action Video, played after Briefing Video.
7: Lose Video, played if you lose the mission.
8: Win Video, played if you win the mission.

(The known videos that you can use are listed below in section 2.1.1. If you
   put an "X" then no movie clip will be played.)

9: Similar to Tech Level. Specifies how much you can build. Note, if you
   play your mission by replacing one in the GENERAL.MIX file (described
   in section 5.1), this will have no effect.
10: Music that will be played when the mission opens. Will begin at the
    same time that the ACTION video begins. A list of know themes can be
    found below in section 2.1.2. To not play any particular music, then
    put "No theme" in the entry.
11: Who the player will represent. GoodGuy (GDI), BadGuy (Nod), Neutral,
    Special, Multi1, Multi2, ... , Multi6.
12: This is the name of the mission which will show up on the NEW MISSIONS
    menu (described in section 5.2). Note: You will not find this entry in
    any mission you extract with MIXMAN, so you will have to add it yourself.

*********************************
2.1.1 Movie Titles and Description
*********************************

   On the lines, Intro, Brief, Action, Lose, and Win, you may put the name
of a video clip which will play at a specified time. Note: If you use the
NEW MISSIONS technique (described in section 5.2) the Intro video will
not be played.
   Most videos are actually usually only on either the GDI or Nod
CD. Below, is a list discovered by someone else, of all the cutscenes
with some additions and corrections that I discovered.

2.1.2 Theme Names
*****************

   After the line, "Theme=" you may put the name of a particular track that
you would like to play when the mission starts. Note: The music will start
right when the ACTION video would start which can cause some performance
problems. Further Note: Spelling and capitilization do matter, and many
of the following songs are not on the normal play list. Some are not even
used in the normal game.

*********
2.2 [Map]
*********
  
   This section will describe the basic map layout. This is one section you
should definitely edit before you use CCMAP to create your map otherwise
you can have some serious problems later. Here's is an example...

[Map]
Height=60                  {1}
Width=60                   {2}
X=2                        {3}
Y=2                        {4}
Theater=TEMPERATE          {5}

1: Height of the map (max 62)
2: Width of the map (max 62)

(Note: Making your map 62x62 can cause problems when you use A-10s or
   transport planes because they don't actually leave the map, but stay at
   the map edge. To deal with this, you should use a maximum of 61x61.
   Actually, just to be safe, I never go over 60x60.)

3: Where the Left border starts in X coordinates.
4: Where the Top border starts in Y coordinates.
5: The type of landscape. Either WINTER, DESERT, or TEMPERATE.
   Note: If you try using TEMPERAT, it may cause your mission to crash.

*********************************************************
2.3 [GoodGuy], [BadGuy], [Neutral], [Special], [Multi1-6]
*********************************************************

   These sections describe the the different sides in a mission.
Here is an example of what they will look like.

[GoodGuy]
FlagHome=0              {1}
FlagLocation=0          {2}
MaxBuilding=150         {3}
MaxUnit=250             {4}
Allies=GoodGuy          {5}
Edge=South              {6}
Credits=50              {7}

1: Unknown. Possibly related to Capture The Flag setting in Multiplayer.
2: Unknown. Possibly related to Capture The Flag setting in Multiplayer.

(Note: The two above values will have no effect on your mission typically
   so you may as well delete them.)

3: Most likely a limit to the number of buildings that can be built.
4: Most likely a limit to the number of units that can be built.
5: Your units will not fire on any units under this section unless you
   tell them to "Force" attack. More than one entry may be placed here
   such as "Allies=GoodGuy, Neutral" though note that this is not a
   reciprocal Alliance. Other units will fire on you even if you consider
   them allies if they are not also set to consider you as allies.
6: This signifies from which direction reinforcements will arrive for this
   house.
7: Number of credits this house will start with divided by 100. For example,
   50 stands for 5000 credits.

   Note: Besides GoodGuy and BadGuy, you may also play as Neutral, Special,
Multi1, Multi2, ... , or Multi6 or have a computer play one of them. If
you choose Neutral or Special, all units of that house will be the same color
as GDI units, but appear gray on the radar. If you play as Neutral, you
cannot build anything, if you play as Special, you can build anything from
either GDI or Nod. If you play as any of the Multi# then your units will
be different colors but still appear gray on the radar. You will also be
able to build anything. The color chart follows...

Multi1:   Blue
Multi2:   Orange
Multi3:   Green
Multi4:   Steel (Gray)
Multi5:   Khaki (GDI color)
Multi6:   Red
GoodGuy:  Khaki
BadGuy:   Red Structures, Gray Units

   Further Note: If you play as Special, or any of the Multi's, even though
you can build anything, if you build a helipad, it will come with an Apache,
not an Orca. Also, if you build a Temple of Nod, you'll get a Nuke, but if
you build an Adv. Com. Center, you won't get an Ion Cannon.

*************
2.4 [Terrain]
*************

   This is where all of the trees, blossom trees, and rocks are layed out.
CCMAP pretty much has this completely worked out so you don't really
have to worry about it, however, here's the basic format...

2080=SPLIT2,None
  |    |     |
  1    2     3

1: Cell position of the Terrain object.
2: The type of object. T## is a various type of tree, TC## is a batch of
   trees, ROCK# is a rock, SPLIT2 and SPLIT3 are blossom trees.
3: A trigger that the terrain piece is associated with. (See section 2.12)

*************
2.5 [Overlay]
*************

   This section describes where things such as Tiberium, walls, and crates
will appear. Again, CCMAP pretty much has this covered, but it doesn't have
crates so I'll describe the format here.

2080=BRIK
  |    |
  1    2

1: Cell position of Overlay tile.
2: What type of tile is there. TI1 ... TI12 are Tiberium. WOOD; wooden fence,
   BARB; barbed wire, SBAG; Sandbag, CYCL; Chain-Link fence, BRIK; concrete
   wall. Recently, I discovered from a mission, by Sunny T. Lee, that FPLS
   is a tile that looks just like the "bullseye" in the Capture the Flag
   setting in multiplayer games. Unfortunately, I haven't seen any
   indication of what the name for the FLAG is, so we can't quite use this
   yet. However, the "bullseye" would probably make a nifty looking Chinook
   drop zone.

   Note: TI1 seems to have just as much Tiberium as TI12, so I'm not sure
what the number means. Density of Tiberium is determined by how many tiles
you have next to each other. To save space, you should usually just use
TI1 which will also make it simpler.
   I discovered that you may also place some civilian buildings on your map
through this section. Refer to section 2.8 for more information.

************
2.5.1 Crates
************

   CCMAP doesn't allow for the placing of crates, however you can still put
them into your missions. In place of TI1 or BRIK or whatever, you can put
either WCRATE or SCRATE standing for wooden crate and steel crate. If you
pick up the WCRATE, you'll get $2000. If you pick up the SCRATE, no effect
will really happen, however you can use it in conjunction with Celltriggers
for a pretty good effect (See section 2.11).
   Note: Very important, if you put crates in your INI file, then use CCMAP
to change your map, and you save it, CCMAP will erase all crate entries you
put in your mission because it doesn't recognize them.

************
2.6 [Smudge]
************

   CCMAP doesn't handle this, but then again, it's not that useful. All it
does is place various scorch marks and craters on the map. Here's the
format anyway...

2080=SC1
  |   |
  1   2

1: Cell position
2: Type of Smudge. SC1 ... SC6 are scorch marks. CR1 ... CR6 are craters.

***************
2.7 [Waypoints]
***************

   These are numbers used in the [TeamType] section which act as shortcuts
to denote postitions on the map. You can have a maximum of 32 waypoints,
(0-31) however, there are 3 waypoints which serve a special purpose.

   Waypoint 25: Yellow Flare will be lit here if specified to do so.
   Waypoint 26: This will be the top-left corner of the screen when you
                start the level. Otherwise, the screen will start at the
                top-left corner of the map.
   Waypoint 27: Default drop site for Chinooks if no "unload" command is
                used in the TeamType section (See section 2.13).

   For waypoints, as well as most values, a -1 means that it is not used.

****************
2.8 [Structures]
****************

   This describes all of the buildings on the map. CCMAP does most of this
for you. All you'll usually need to do here is change the building health,
and trigger association. Here is an example...

000=GoodGuy,FACT,256,2080,0,None
 |     |      |   |    |  |  |
 1     2      3   4    5  6  7

1: Building Index. Not really important.
2: Building Owner.
3: Building Type. (See section 2.8.1 for the chart)
4: Health. Note: this is a proportional health, so 256 is the maximum for
   every structure. If you want to change a structure's health, you should
   definitely do it here rather than CCMAP where you will have to change
   the health by one unit per one click.
5: Cell postion of building. Usually the upper left corner of the building.
6: Direction which building faces. Only useful for Gun Turrets. can be any
   value from 0-255. 0=North, 64=East, 128=South, 192=West.
7: Name of a trigger building is associated with. (See section 2.12)

   Note: It is possible to also place some civilian buildings through the
[Overlay] section instead. You would do this by making an entry such as...

2080=V12

This will cause the building to be seen at that cell position, however, you
will not be able to select or attack this building. The usefulness of this
option is mainly for decoration. I believe that this will only work for
TEMPERATE and WINTER theaters for the civilian buildings which are actually
various crop fields etc.

2.8.2 Civilian Structures that CCMAP v2.1 Doesn't Handle
********************************************************

   You may have already noticed that if you attempt to place civilian
structures on your map with CCMAP while using DESERT environment, they
will all not be shown on your map. This is because apparently different
graphics are used for structures between TEMPERATE and WINTER, and DESERT.
   Below is a list of the Civilian Structures that will work in the
DESERT environment (but not TEMPERATE and WINTER) as well as a brief
description of each. With this chart, you can first use CCMAP to place
several buildings so you'll know the cell positions of where you want your
buildings to be, then just use this chart to swap the "V##" in your INI
file after making your map, with one from the chart.

    Building
  Abbreviation        Building Description
*****************************************************************************
      V19             Oil Pump (Same as TEMPERATE and WINTER)
      V20             Two wooden structures and a clothesline
      V21             Wooden structure and clothesline
      V22             Wooden structure and clothesline
      V23             Village Well and clothesline
      V24             Concrete structure with wooden attachment
      V25             Church
      V26             Two wooden structures
      V27             Concrete structure
      V28             Wooden structure
      V29             Wooden structure
      V30             Village Well and Stable
      V31             Hut with skulls on pikes. Witch Doctor's Hut?
      V32             Two huts
      V33             Two huts
      V34             A hut
      V35             A hut
      V36             A hut
      V37             Large building. Looks like... Library? College?

   Furthermore, strcutures in TEMPERATE and WINTER scenarios usually look
identical except for some snow. However, V12 and V13 appear as circular
haystacks in the TEMPERATE theater (in CCMAP as well), but appear as igloos
in the WINTER theater.

***********
2.9 [Units]
***********

   Very similar to [Structures]. CCMAP does most of it again, but you
may want to change a few values. Here's the format...

000=GoodGuy,JEEP,256,2080,0,Guard,None
 |     |      |   |    |  |   |    |

   Hunt:           Search for and attack enemy units and/or base.
   Attack Tarcom:  Unknown
   Defend Base:    Defend own base
   Guard:          Simlar to Area Guard, but less aggressive.

   Sticky:         Stay at the cell, whatever happens. Won't return fire
                   unless attacked.

8: Trigger Unit is associated with.

   Indeed, there are Dinos in the game. Use CCEDIT from Andrew Griffin to
      be able to see them.
   Without using CCEDIT or some simliar program, the usefulness of the
      C17 transport plane is questionable. Since it's Cannot Land flag is on,
      when I tried to get it to move somewhere, it caused my game to crash.

***************
2.10 [Infantry]
***************

   This describes all of the personnel on the map. Similar again to Units.
   Here's the format...

000=GoodGuy,E1,256,2080,0,Guard,0,None
 |     |    |   |    |  |   |   |  |
 1     2    3   4    5  6   7   8  9

1: Infantry Index. Not very important.
2: Infantry Owner.
3: Infantry Type.
   E1: Minigunner           RMBO:      Commando
   E2: Grenadier            C1..C10:   Various Civilians
   E3: Rocketeer            MOEBIUS:   Dr. Moebius
   E4: Flame Thrower        DELPHI:    Agent Delphi
   E5: Chemical Warrior     CHAN:      Civilian in lab coat
   E6: Engineer
4: Proportional Health.
5: Cell position
6: Sub-Cellnumber. Each Cell is divided into 5 sub-cells which you can place
   the infantry into. Note: If you put more than one infantry in one cell,
   and then use CCMAP to change the map and save it, CCMAP will erase all
   of the infantry except one for each cell. Sub-Cell division...
                        1   2
                          0
                        3   4
7: Action Infantry takes. Same as Units.
8: Direction facing. Same as Units.
9: Trigger Infantry is associated with.

*******************
2.11 [Celltriggers]
*******************

   You will need to add these yourself. You will use them when you want
something to happen in your mission when a cell is entered by a unit.
Each one needs a corresponding normal "Trigger" with a "Player Enters"
activator. Here's the format...

2080=ALRT
  |   |
  1   2

1: Cell Position of Celltrigger.
2: Trigger that Celltrigger is associated with.

   For example, if a unit moves onto the 2080 cell position, then the
trigger named ALRT will be activated.

***************
2.12 [Triggers]
***************

   This and TeamTypes are probably the two most complicated parts of the
INI file. In this section, you will describe just about everything that
will happen in your mission. Here's the format...

Zap=Time,Ion Cannon,180,GoodGuy,None,1
 |   |       |       |     |      |  |
 1   2       3       4     5      6  7

1: Trigger name. Can be just about anything. Try to keep it short.
2: Trigger activator. What must happen for the trigger to start...
   # Bldgs Dstr.           : if specified number of struc. are destroyed.
   # Units Dstr.           : if     "        "   "  units   "     "
   All Destr.              : if EVERYTHING of one side is destroyed
   Any                     : used with Cap=Win/Des=Lose effect (see below)
   Attacked                : if unit/structure/terrain/infantry gets attacked
   Bldgs Destr.            : if all buildings of one side have been destroyed
   Built it                : if a specific structure was built
   Civ. Evac.              : if civilians have been evacuated (by Chinook?)
   Credits                 : certain amount of credits is reached
   Destroyed               : if unit/structure/terrain/infantry is destroyed
   Discovered              : if unit/structure/terrain/infantry is discovered
   House Discov.           : if a certain side (House) has been discovered
   No Factories            : if all Constr. Yard are destroyed
   Player Enters           : if this cell is entered. Used when associated
                             with celltriggers. Can also be used to activate
                             when a building is captured by an Engineer.
   Time                    : if a certain amount of time has passed
   Units Destr.            : if all vehicles and soldiers are destroyed
3: Effect of trigger. What will happen once the activator has been satisfied.
   Airstrike               : Airstrike available. Note: Don't use this to
                             give the computer air strikes. Use the method
                             described in the TeamTypes section.
   All to Hunt             : Everybody searches for and attacks the enemy
   Allow Win               : Used when there is more than one goal
                             to win the mission. You will have one of
                             the goals as Allow Win, and the other
                             would simply be Win.
   Autocreate              : Random create a team specified in TEAMTYPES
   Cap=Win/Des=Lose        : For buildings: captured=win/destroyed=lose
   Create Team             : Create a specific team with name at '6'
                             Note: If all of the units neccesesary for
                             the team being created are already on the
                             map and are doing nothing else, they will
                             become the team. Otherwise, the team will
                             be built back at the computer's base.
   Dstry Teams             : Unknown
   Dstry Trig 'XXXX'       : Destroy trigger with name XXXX. For example:
                             you can attach XXXX to a timed Ion 
                             Cannon attack. If for example the 
                             Com. Center is destroyed which has that
                             trigger XXXX, no more Ion Cannons will
                             be fired anymore.
   Dstry Trig 'YYYY'       :  "         "             "          "
   Dstry Trig 'ZZZZ'       :  "         "             "          "
   DZ at 'Z'               : Yellow flare is lit at waypoint 25
   Ion Cannon              : Ion cannon available
   Lose                    : You lose the mission
   Reinforce.              : Reinforcements arrive
   Win                     : You win the mission
   Nuclear Missile         : Nuke available 
   Production              : Until this effect occurs, the computer will
                             not rebuild any of it's buildings or build
                             any teams back at it's base.
4: This is a counter which is related to the activator. It can count things
   like time units, # of buildings destroyed, number of credits, or type
   of building built. Time units vary from computer to computer, but when I
   tried it on my 486DX2/66 with 8 meg RAM, 8 time units was about equal to
   1 minute. Further Note: The counter for Built It denotes what building
   needs to be built. The proper indeces are listed under the Structures
   section 2.8.1.
5: House associated with activator. Can mean different things with different
   with different activators.
6: TeamType associated with trigger or "None" for no team. The name you
   make up can be pretty much anything, though try to keep it short.
7: Looping Bit. If value is 0, trigger will only be activated once. If it
   is either 1 or 2, then trigger will be activated whenever it's activator
   has been satisfied.

   Note: When you make your mission, don't forget you have to have a trigger
for Win, and one for Lose. If you want the computer to also build stuff, you
will also need a Production trigger.

****************
2.13 [TeamTypes]
****************
   
   This can be a complicated section, because there are several numbers here
which no one short of the programmers really understands. Here's the basic
format...

ATeam=GoodGuy,1,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,2,RMBO:5,APC:1,2,Move:0,Guard,50,0,0
^^^^^ ^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^
  |      |             |        |      |       |        |         |
  1      2             3        4      5       6        7         8

1: Name of Team. can be just about anything. Try to keep it short.
2: Owner of Team.
3: Bizzare assortment of numbers. Not sure exactly what they mean. Here are
   some basic patterns which should be all that you need...

   * Reinforce by Chinook, Hovercraft, APC, A-10s or by any other units
     moving in from the side of the screen.
       1,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0
   * Reinforce by an empty Chinook that you can select and control.
       0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0
   * Create a team from base, or from the field if available.
       1,0,0,1,0,15,1,0,0

Note: These aren't very sure numbers. Sometimes if you use the first pattern
   you can still use it with CREATE TEAM etc. but basically these work fine.
   Further: When you want to let the computer have an Air Strike to send
   against you, rather than use the "Airstrike" effect in the trigger, use
   "Reinforce." and make a team type similar to the following.

   a10s=GoodGuy,1,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,1,A10:3,0,0,0

      Also, if you send for reinforcements by land, you should make the side
   that they come from only have one opening while all other parts of that
   edge are covered by some map pieces so that you can "force" the
   reinforcements to come out where you want them to. Otherwise they'll just
   come out of the one side in a random position.

4: Number of different Types of units.
5: The different units, using same abbreviations as under Units and Infantry.
   The number after the colon represents how many of the preceding unit.
   For example, RMBO:5,APC:1 stands for 5 commandos and 1 APC, in this case
   the 5 commandos will be in the APC.

      Note: If you send reinforcements via Chinook, you can have it unload
   as many units as you like including vehicles.

6: Number of actions the team will undertake. In this case two. Can be 0.
   You should usually use 0 here for hovercraft reinforcements, and A-10s.
7: Actions that the team will take.
    Move:#         Move to the waypoint which would be in place of #
    Unload:#       Unload a Chinook, hovercraft, or APC
    Loop           Repeat previous actions.

   In addition to the above, are all of the commands under the Units section.
After those actions would follow ":##" where ## stands for the number of
time units the team will undertake that action. Note: When a unit or team is
set to Hunt or attack something, it will attack the most North Western unit
that is visible by the player.

8: These two 0's aren't really known as to what they do. But, all Teams
   usually end with them or 1,0 but just leave it at 0,0.

***********
2.14 [Base]
***********

   This section will specify which buildings the computer will rebuild and
which ones it won't bother to. Here's the format...

000=NUKE,151006464
 |   |       |
 1   2       3

1: Index of the Base line, not very important.
2: The type of building to be rebuilt.
3: Very confusing set of numbers which specifies the location of the
   building. It is recommended that you simply use something like CCTOOLS
   to do this, otherwise you will really need a calculator badly.
   The formula for this number I received from Andrew Griffin who got it
   from someone else.

   [ ( y * 65472 ) + CellNumber ] * 256

   Where Y is equal to the building's Y coordinate. You can find this out
   if you know the Cell position with the formula...

   y = Trunc ( CellNumber / 64 )

   Trunc means to truncate, or to only take the integer part of the number.
   For example, if a buildings cell number is 160, then you would divide
   it by 64 giving you 2.5. Then you would truncate 2.5 giving you 2 which
   is the Y position of the building which you can use in the formula.

   At the end of the [Base] section, should be a line of the form
"Count=X" where X is the number of entries.
   Another useful method of using this section is calculating the positions
of all of the computer's buildings with the above formula. Then, instead
of giving the computer all of those buildings, just give it a Construction
Yard and a lot of money and it will build up its base from scratch.

***************
2.15 [Briefing]
***************

   When you make your custom mission, you want to have a description of the
mission and this is where you put it. When you have this section, it will
appear just like in Covert Operations after you would see the Brief and
Action video clips. The format is as follows...

[Briefing]
1=You would be typing your briefing description here. However it is
2=VERY important that your briefing not be too long. I have discovered
3=that in total, your briefing may not contain more than 260 ASCII
4=characters, though it can have as many lines as you want.

   I did find that if your briefing contains more than 260 characters, then
when your mission starts, it will play music during your cutscenes even
if you don't want it to, then during the mission it won't play music at all.
Basically, keep it under 260 characters or else it will screw up the mission
pretty badly.

***********
3. Examples
***********

   I would recommend that you try using an INI editor like CCTOOLS at first
to help you out. What follows are some examples which should help you out.
Another very good way to help you out is to extract INIs from the GENERAL.MIX
files and look at some of the real examples there.

* If you (BadGuy) pick up a steel crate at cell position 1063, then a flare
  will be lit at cell position 1000 making it appear as though when you pick

* At the beginning of the mission, you (GoodGuy) will receive reinforcements
  in the form of an MCV on a hovercraft, and a few seconds later, you'll
  get another hovercraft with a Mammoth Tank on it. Note: As far as my
  testing has found, Hovercrafts may only come up from the South.

* A common trigger in GDI missions which you can replicate is to give
  yourself Air Strikes after all SAM sites have been destroyed. In this
  example, once the four SAMs have been destroyed you get your Air Strike.

* There is a wooden crate at cell position 2000 and another at cell
  position 3000. You (Multi1) are trying to get the one at position 2000, and
  the computer (Multi2) is trying to get the one at position 3000 with his
  APC. If you get yours first, you win. If the AI (computer) gets its first,
  then you lose. The APC will go for the crate as soon as the mission starts.

  Note: This is still a good example, however since it was written I
        discovered that it will not work because the computer player cannot
        move onto a cell which has a crate on it.

* Here's a trigger you've probably also seen before in some GDI missions.
  In this one, to win, you must evacuate Dr. Moebius in a Chinook, which
  will come after you destroy all Nod SAM sites, to win the mission. However,
  in this example, in addition, you must also destroy Nod's Bio-Research
  Facility. Furthermore, if Moebius dies, then you lose the mission. Note:
  When you have a "Civ. Evac." trigger activator, when you load a civilian
  (Moebius) into the Chinook, it automatically flys off. Phew, this one's
  getting complicated.

4. Making Multiplayer Maps
**************************

   Making Multiplayer maps is actually much simpler than making single player
maps because mainly all you need to do is make the map and that's it.
   First start out as usual, create your map, then before exiting CCMAP,
look through the map you created and find the cell numbers of all the
possible start postitions that you would like.
   Now, under the waypoints section, use all of those starting position
cell numbers and use them as the first few waypoints, (0,1,2,...). Depending
on how many you place, that is the number of possible starting positions.
   From there, you're pretty much done, all you have to do is add a Name
entry and use the techniques described below to make the map playable.
   I haven't confirmed it, however I've heard that if you put units in your
map, regardless of color, they will be hostile to all players. Since the
last revision, I have tested it, and Triggers will NOT work in multiplayer
maps. Furthermore, you cannot place crates in a multiplayer map either. In
both cases, they simply won't show up in your map.

*******************************
5. Making Your Mission Playable
*******************************

   Well, now that you've made your great, or not so great mission, you need
to be able to play it so that you can test it. I shall describe two
techniques to do this. I would highly recommend the NEW MISSIONS method over
the GENERAL.MIX method, but in order to use the NEW MISSIONS method, you need
either the Covert Operations CD installed, or the Covert Operations demo.

************************************
5.1 GENERAL.MIX to Hard Drive Method
************************************

   This method will require MIXMAN, a hexidecimal editor, and for you to
copy some files to your hard drive. First off, if you made a GDI mission,
then copy the GENERAL.MIX file from the GDI CD to your C&C directory, or
from the Nod CD if your mission is a Nod mission. Once you've done that,
rename GENERAL.MIX to GENER.MIX. Next, you will need a Hexadecimal editor
(a text editor will not work). Use the Hex editor to search the GAME.DAT
file in your C&C directory for two occurences of "GENERAL.MIX" then change
both of these to "C:GENER.MIX" with your editor. It is strongly recommended
that you make a back-up copy of your GAME.DAT file first because making
mistaken hex edits can seriously screw up your program.
   Now that this is done, use MIXMAN to replace two matching INI and MAP
files in the new GENER.MIX file with the two you created. Replace a
mission who's number is the same as the BuildLevel that you want. Then,
start up the game, and load a savegame you have on the mission which you
replaced and then select restart.
   Note: When using this method, the Name you gave your mission will never
appear, and the briefing will not be shown unless you select Restate.

***********************
5.2 NEW MISSIONS Method
***********************

   This method works much better however it requires that you either have
the Covert Operations CD installed, or the Covert Operations demo.
   When you have one of the above, in the main menu there will be a button
labeled NEW MISSIONS. After you've done the following, your mission will
appear in that menu for you to start from.
   Once you've completed making your mission, name it in the method described
in the [Basic] section otherwise you'll just see an "X", then you should
probably also give the mission a [Briefing] section. Note: If your mission
has a video clip for the Intro section, it won't be shown.
   Now that you have done that, you must name your INI and MAP file properly.
If you have a GDI mission, name both files SCG##EA.* Rename the MAP file
to have the extension BIN instead. In place of the "##" you need to put
a number. Most of the numbers upto 30 are used by the campaign and
Covert Operations. Just to be safe, simply name it 50 or 60, anything
upto 99. So you should have two files named something like SCG50EA.INI and
SCG50EA.BIN. Now when you start the game and press the NEW MISSIONS button,
in the menu near the end should be your mission.
   If the mission you made was Nod rather than GDI, then instead name the
files as SCB##EA.*. To make multiplayer maps, name them as SCM##EA.*

***************************************
6. Where to Send Your Completed Mission
***************************************

   Now before you do send your mission to some web site so that people may
play it, I'd like to make a few highly opinionated opinions. DON'T just
send a mission as soon as you can get it to run without crashing. Take the
time to make it at least reasonably fun to play. Making it fun to play
(in my opinion anyway) means to...

(1): Make sure it works correctly first (you'd be surprised that some people
     don't understand this). 
(2): Supplement your mission with at least a fairly decent story line. It
     doesn't even have to be great, but as long as there is one. It is
     very annoying to see someone make a mission, and all the briefing is,
     "Okay, kill everything." That really makes the mission boring. However,
     when you do write your story, try not to deter from the original plot.
(3): Most importantly, THE BEST MISSION IS NOT THE HARDEST MISSION. It is
     extremely annoying when people make their missions impossibly hard.
     Missions should be a challenge, not a migraine.

   Now that you've read my fanatical ravings, I suppose I can tell you that
probably the best place to post your missions (also probably the best C&C
web site) is "The Temple of the Conquerer" at http://www10.torget.se/temple.
The only other site I've found which is for posting single player missions
is "http://www.communique.net/~dream" although they haven't yet posted the
missions I sent them so I'm not so sure how prompt they are.
   If you make a multiplayer map, it is probably best to send it to the web
site for CC-MAP PACK or something like that. I don't know the URL for that
one, but just use a link from another site or do a search.
   I'm sure there are other good places to send your missions, but thus far,
these are the only two which I'm aware of.

7. Final Comments
*****************

   Hopefully this should help many of you out there, I certainly hope so
since this took me several hours to write. If you have any further
questions about INI editing, comments, or new information about INI
editing that I could put into an update (giving you credit of course)
then send me an e-mail at MastrMind3@aol.com.

***************
8. Thanks To...
***************

   Thanks to a whole bunch of people. Andrew Griffin for his help with some
of the questions I originally had, Han Brunger definitely for making the
original manual which helped immensely in the creation of this document,
Vladan Bato for MIXMAN as well as answering some of my questions, and
Richard Heesbeen and Jeroen Ritmeijer for the really cool CCMAP which helped
a lot not only in making my custom missions, but in testing missions to
create this document. Westwood Studios for the best game I've played to
date without which this manual would be meaningless. Of course, hopefully
this it won't have been the best game I've played after October.
   Still there's more. Thanks to the person who figured the names of all
the movie clips, and the person who figured out the music tracks. Sorry,
but I don't know either of your names.
   Wait I'm not done yet. There are probably dozens more people I who
deserve thanks, but I'm only mortal and I'm not able to remember everybody.
Some such people could include you as I got some of my information from
looking at the custom missions people have made and posted.
